## Daily Rewards Configuration

All rewards could be customized over the configuration file under `config/daily_rewards_common.toml`.

### Fill Items

Fill items are used to fill the reward list to the number of days in a month.

- If you provide a list of items less than the number of days in a month, the list will be extended by fill items to match the number of days in a month.
- If you don't want to have fill items, you can set the `useFillItems` to `false`.
- If you provide a list of items equal or greater than the number of days in a month, the list will be truncated to the number of days in a month without any fill items or randomization.

### Randomization

The randomization is used to randomize the reward list for each month.
This is helpful in the case fill items are used to distribute the fill items and rewards more evenly over the month.
The randomization could be disabled by setting `useRandomization` to `false`.

### Preview reward data

You can preview the configured rewards for each month based on the configuration over the `/DailyRewards preview ...` command.
Example: `DailyRewards preview April`

Please keep in mind that the preview could be different from the actually result if you haven't define a reward for each single day.

### Reset reward data

If you want to reset the rewards for the current month, the easiest way is to delete the reward data files inside your world folder under:

- `data/daily_rewards_user.dat`
- `data/daily_rewards.dat`

Alternative you could use an NBT editor to directly edit the files for a specific day.
After the change you need to restart the server, to re-calculate the current daily rewards based on your configuration.
